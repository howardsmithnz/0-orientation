## Typing and Shortcuts
It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

- Take a baseline [test](http://www.typingtest.com/index.html) to see how fast you currently type.
- To learn the basics in touch typing and to improve your speeds, try either [typingstudy](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) or [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html).
- If you are already an accomplished touch typist, try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols.
- For shortcuts, try [shortcutfoo](http://www.shortcutfoo.com). You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.
You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
